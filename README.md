# What is Big Data ?

Big Data is term for:
    -> massive data sets, with varied and complex structure
    -> with difficulties of storing and analysing
    -> visualizing for further processes or results

# Timely decisions require new data in minutes
    -> data loses value quickly over time
    -> so, we need to time critical decisions

# Challenges working with data
    -> in many cases, a single database is not capable of handling all the users
    -> data generated vs data available for analysis


# Our dataset - Top Trending Videos

What is "trending" ?
    -> Youtube uses factors, including user interactions. Ex - number of views, shares, comments & likes
    -> not the most-viewed videso overall for the calendar year
    -> source - Kaggle, data collected using Youtube API


# On-Premise Data Centre
    -> you/your company has it's own hardware
    -> you'll need to maintain it
        -> purchase, fix & upgrade hardware
        -> install and maintain Operating Systems and other software
    -> this can be challenging at times, so we use the CLOUD
        -> procurement, approval, licensing
        -> shipping, installation, electricity, cooling systems ...
        -> underutilized vs overutilized
        -> pay even when nobody is using the hardware
        -> sustainability issues

# The Cloud
    -> applications delivered as services over the Internet
    -> Hardware and systems software in data centres, that provide those services
